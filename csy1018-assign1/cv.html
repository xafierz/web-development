<h6> What I am capable of in terms of my own skills </h6>

<p> My personal skills vary in fields such as, I am capable of building a computer doing diagnostics and fixing any problems, but
  I am not profficient to any sort of coding, such as HTML, CSS etc. Other skills such as good time management skills, I never
  leave work to be done at the last second, it's almost not like a skill but more like a habbit. </p>
