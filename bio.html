<h1> About Me </h1>

 <div id="aboutme">

 <p>  I was born in a country called Lithuania, it's a really tiny country that is located next to
 russia (but it is not part of it). In late 2012 we've moved to Englang to achieve a better life and success.
 In order to do so I've decided to start studying and join a University and get a diploma. Aside from
 stories of where I live, I am a normal guy who likes playing
 video games competitively and enjoys doing anything with computers. Because of my course,
 I am able to try out everything to see what I like the most, so far mostly i've been into communications and programming
 which is both for web dev and sudo etc.  </p>
